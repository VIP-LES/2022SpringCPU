Hello!


This is GT VIP - Lightning from the Edge of Space's Code for our Spring 2022 Launch


We compiled all of our sensors and wrote into a CSV which can be found in the Spring 2022 Data directory.

All of our libraries are included. This semester we utilized a RaspberryPi as our microcontroller
and a headless setup for all of our field activities. 

This was done by the CPU subteam of the Blue/Sensors Subteam.
